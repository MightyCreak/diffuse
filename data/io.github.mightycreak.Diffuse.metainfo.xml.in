    <release version="0.7.0" date="2021-11-16">
      <description>
        <p>
          With this release, the main end-user change is the <strong>new
          icon</strong>. The rest is mainly maintenance improvements with a
          much more standard folder structure and starting to modularize the
          code. This is an ongoing effort as there is still a lot to do, but
          hopefully this would motivate some to contribute ;)
        </p>
        <p>
          An important note though: the application ID has changed and is now
          io.github.mightycreak.Diffuse.
        </p>
        <p>Added:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>New icon and in SVG now</li>
          <li>Started to modularize the code</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Changed:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Changed AppID to io.github.mightycreak.Diffuse (as explained in <a
            href="https://docs.flatpak.org/en/latest/conventions.html#application-ids">
            Flatpak documentation</a>)
          </li>
          <li>Renamed directory `translations/` to `po/`</li>
          <li>Now uses POTFILES.in to list the files to translate</li>
          <li>
            Translation strings are no longer sorted alphabetically, this will
            help when there will be several files in POTFILES.in
          </li>
          <li>Updated the documentation and script in the `po/` directory</li>
          <li>Add .desktop translations in .po files</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Fixed:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Fixed some GTK deprecation warnings</li>
        </ul>

    <release version="0.6.0" date="2020-11-29">
      <description>
        <p>
          Mainly under the hood changes in this release, so nothing really
          visible to the users in this version. That said, I figured it was a
          long time since the last release (4 months ago) and, as promised, I
          want Diffuse development to be a bit more active and iterative.
        </p>
        <p>
          Apart from the maintenance changes 🧰, I think the main improvement
          is that Diffuse will soon be available through Flathub!
        </p>
        <p>Added:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>New Flatpak package, published on Flathub: com.github.mightycreak.Diffuse</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Changed:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Replace old install.py with the more standard Meson</li>
          <li>Remove u string prefixes since Python 3 is in UTF-8 by default</li>
          <li>Replaced some interpolation operators (%) for the f string prefix</li>
          <li>Use the window scale factor for the icons generation</li>
        </ul>

    <release version="0.5.0" date="2020-07-18">
      <description>
        <p>
          Here is the v0.5.0. Unintentionally, this release happens exactly 6
          years after the previous v0.4.8 release!
        </p>
        <p>
          There is a lot to do on this application, and some features didn't
          make the release. The main one being the Windows installers. I think
          6 years is too long to continue to wait until this bug is fixed. The
          Python scripts should work on Windows, but no executable is produced
          (yet) with the release.
        </p>
        <p>
          Other than that, Diffuse v0.5.0 is now officially compatible with
          Python 3 and GTK 3! And it is synced to the latest commits from
          upstream (which were never released).
        </p>
        <p>
          The next version will not take 6 years, I promise you! 😄
        </p>
