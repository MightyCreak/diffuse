get the latest and greatest as quickly as possible. The Flatpak package is
hosted on [Flathub](https://flathub.org).

[these instructions](https://flatpak.org/setup/).

### Using the distribution package manager

The Diffuse package statuses for every distributions can been seen on
[repology](https://repology.org/project/diffuse/versions).
